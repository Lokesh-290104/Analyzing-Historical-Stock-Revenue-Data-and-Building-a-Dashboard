# Analyzing Historical Stock Revenue Data and Building a Dashboard

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing historical stock revenue data and visualizing the insights through an interactive dashboard. By extracting stock data from various sources, performing data cleaning and analysis, and leveraging visualization tools, this project provides meaningful insights into stock performance over time.

## Objectives
- Extract historical stock price and revenue data.
- Clean and preprocess the dataset for analysis.
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify trends and patterns.
- Build an interactive dashboard to visualize stock trends and revenue insights.

## Data Sources
The stock data is sourced from:
- **Yahoo Finance API** using the `yfinance` Python package.
- **Web scraping** with `requests` and `BeautifulSoup` for additional stock-related data.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: For data extraction, cleaning, and analysis.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and preprocessing.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For static visualizations.
- **Plotly/Dash/Power BI**: For interactive dashboard creation.
- **Flask/Django (Optional)**: If deploying as a web-based application.

## Project Workflow
1. **Data Extraction**:
   - Fetch stock data using `yfinance`.
   - Scrape additional data using `requests` and `BeautifulSoup`.
   
2. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**:
   - Handle missing values.
   - Convert data types where necessary.
   - Ensure consistency in date formats.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Visualize trends in stock price and revenue.
   - Analyze correlations between different stock parameters.

4. **Dashboard Development**:
   - Create visualizations using `Plotly` or `Power BI`.
   - Build an interactive dashboard for stock data exploration.

5. **Deployment (Optional)**:
   - Deploy the dashboard using Flask, Django, or Streamlit.

## Installation
### Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python installed (>=3.7). Install required dependencies using:
```bash
pip install yfinance pandas requests beautifulsoup4 matplotlib seaborn plotly dash
```

## Usage
1. **Run the data extraction script**:
   ```bash
   python extract_stock_data.py
   ```
2. **Analyze the data**:
   ```bash
   python analyze_stock_data.py
   ```
3. **Launch the dashboard**:
   ```bash
   python app.py  # If using Flask/Dash
   ```

## Results & Insights
- Trends in stock prices over different timeframes.
- Revenue fluctuations and their impact on stock performance.
- Correlation between volume, closing price, and market trends.

## Future Enhancements
- Add real-time stock data updates.
- Integrate predictive models for stock price forecasting.
- Enhance the dashboard with more advanced filtering options.
